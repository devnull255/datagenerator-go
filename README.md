# datagenerator-go

## Overview

Implemented a basic datagenerator package in go.
This is really just another way for me to learn a new language while creating a useful piece of reusable code in that language.  Coding the datagenerator in any language requires me to learn core common features I need for most common programming tasks, like seeding and generating random numbers, manipulating array and list structures, string formatting and manipulation, mathematical operations, iteration, stream and file I/O, processing command-line arguments, etc.
